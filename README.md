# Tidy Tuesday Projects

This repository contains my data analysis projects for the #TidyTuesday challenge, a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem.

## About Tidy Tuesday

TidyTuesday is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. Every week, a new dataset is posted for the R community to explore and visualize. More information can be found at: [github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
- Each year has its own folder (e.g., `2025/`)
- Within each year, each week has its own folder (e.g., `2025/week_20/`)
- Each week folder contains:
  - The R script(s) for the analysis
